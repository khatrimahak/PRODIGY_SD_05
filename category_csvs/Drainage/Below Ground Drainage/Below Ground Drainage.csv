When excavation work is required to repair a damaged pipe, Flexseal standard coupling will reduces the amount of time required and minor differences in pipe diameter can be accommodated. The combination of a durable design and excellent sealing properties when tightened to the correct torque enable the Flexseal standard coupling to provide a reliable seal on rough pipe surfaces. It can be combined with Flexseal bushes in order to act as an adaptor between pipelines of differing outside diameters.
