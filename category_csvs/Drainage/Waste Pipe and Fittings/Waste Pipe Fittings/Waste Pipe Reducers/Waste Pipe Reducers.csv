Offering excellent levels of sound insulation, the Silent-db20 system minimises the disturbances that can be caused by noisy waste removal in multi-occupancy premises. Geberit Silent-db20 fulfils existing sound insulation requirements without difficulty, because the sound insulation comes already installed.  Made of mineral-reinforced polyethylene (PE-S2) which lends the pipes and fittings an increased weight, reducing both their natural vibration and the sound it generates.  Sound insulation ribs in the impact zones further reduce noise development.  In addition, system pipe brackets for wall fastening decouple the drainage system acoustically from both walls and ceilings, thus preventing a transmission of solid-borne sound.",Drainage/Waste Pipe and Fittings/Waste Pipe Fittings/Waste Pipe Reducers/Waste Pipe Reducers.csv -> Geberit Silent-db20 eccentric reducer 110 x 56mm,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/ma/ge/F02002_Primary_Image_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/og/ue/Geberit_HDPE_Silent_db20_Catalogue.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ui/de/Geberit_DrainageSystem_Product_Guide.pdf,,,
