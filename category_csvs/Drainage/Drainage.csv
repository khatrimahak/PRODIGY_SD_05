When excavation work is required to repair a damaged pipe, Flexseal standard coupling will reduces the amount of time required and minor differences in pipe diameter can be accommodated. The combination of a durable design and excellent sealing properties when tightened to the correct torque enable the Flexseal standard coupling to provide a reliable seal on rough pipe surfaces. It can be combined with Flexseal bushes in order to act as an adaptor between pipelines of differing outside diameters. Standard coupling is made from EN681-1 EPDM rubber and has grade 1.4401 (316) stainless steel clamps and shear bands.",Drainage/Drainage.csv -> Flexseal standard couplong 100-115mm,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/15/00/NW-F91500_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/_d/op/Flexseal_01_Coupling_EN295_DoP.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ui/de/Flexseal_Drainage_Plumb_System_Guide.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/an/ce/Flexseal_Declaration_Of_Performance.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ic/al/Flexseal_Standard_Coupling_Technical.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ms/ds/Flexseal_EPDM_Coupling_MSDS.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
