The product range includes pipes and fittings with dimensions between 40mm and 315mm. Wavin HDPE is a complete soil, waste and vent system of pipes and fittings, manufactured from high-density polyethylene (PE HD). This tough and durable HDPE system offers an extraordinary chemical resistance in combination with a high flexibility level and great impact resistance. Wavin HDPE pipes and fittings are jointed by welding, making the joints resistant to tension. There are two methods of welding: butt welding and electro-fusion welding.
