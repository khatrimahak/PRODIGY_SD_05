Selections are available with cellar temperatures from 4°C to 12°C, which will meet the increasing range of cooling requirements for pubs, clubs and wine bars. In addition, sound levels have been minimised throughout the range of BMO condensing units and BMIE evaporators. Consisting of compact BMO outdoor, weatherproof, housed units aligned with space saving BMIE evaporators now incorporating EC fan technology, the Climate Center Beermaster range is the solution to all cellar cooling applications. Operating two BMIE evaporators will successfully cool cellars with irregular shapes (with one BMO condensing unit.)
