Supplied in a 15M coil, this insulation has very low thermal conductivity alongside high levels of resistance to water vapour transmission, helping to reduce energy losses during the long term while also minimising moisture ingress and reducing the risk of corrosion under insulation (CUI). Suitable for installation in public buildings and for use in process industries, AF Evo has inbuilt antimicrobial protection and high levels of fire performance make it a reliable choice for even the most challenging of situations.
