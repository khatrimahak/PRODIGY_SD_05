A solder joint is created through the principle of capillary action. When fitting and tube are heated to the correct temperature, the solder becomes molten, allowing it to be drawn into the gap between the two for a tough, reliable joint.",School's Out/School's Out.csv -> Center CB 635810 integral solder ring straight coupling 22mm,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/58/14/NW-635807_635814_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ic/al/635810_Center_Technical.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
