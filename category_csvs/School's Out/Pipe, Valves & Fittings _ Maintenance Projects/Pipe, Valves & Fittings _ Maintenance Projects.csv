135,PK74461,JET Range 55 copper x copper wheel head gate valve 35mm Bronze,JET Range,178.07,"This JET Range 55 gate valve is designed for isolating pipelines. With 35mm compression connections, the valve includes a bronze body, wedge, screwed bonnet, non-rising stem, wheel handle and forged brass compression nuts. A gate valve, also known as a sluice valve, opens by lifting a barrier out of the path of a fluid. Gate valves normally require minimal space along the pipe axis and offer minimal flow restriction when fully open. A multiturn valve, operation of a gate valve is carried out via a threaded stem, turning multiple times to change position.","School's Out/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects.csv -> JET Range 55 copper x copper wheel head gate valve 35mm Bronze",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/44/63/NW-K74458_K74463_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ti/on/Jet_JET55_JET55LS_Installation.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/20/16/Jet_Valve_Guide_2016.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lever-operated, this valve is made of robust DZR brass with PTFE seals and a steel lever. The 100YL provides full flow with the minimum of turbulence when in the open position while the closed position ensures a bubble tight closure.  A ball valve is a type of quarter-turn valve featuring a hollow, perforated ball that pivots to control the flow of a fluid. The valve is open when the ball's hole is in line with flow and closed when pivoted to 90°. The long lasting reliability of ball valves makes them popular in a wide range of settings.","School's Out/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects.csv -> Hattersley Ball Valves 100YL DZR gas ball valve PN25 15mm",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/25/28/NW-K22523_K22528_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ta/ll/Hattersley_Fig100YL_BalValve_Install.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/te/ch/Hattersley_Fig100YL_BallValve_Tech.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Made of DZR bronze with a PTFE seal, the D171A.PF has a red steel lever.  A ball valve is a type of quarter-turn valve featuring a hollow, perforated ball that pivots to control the flow of a fluid. The valve is open when the ball's hole is in line with flow and closed when pivoted to 90°. The long lasting reliability of ball valves makes them popular in a wide range of settings.","School's Out/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects.csv -> Crane Ball Valve D171AEXS DZR ball valve (BSP) PN25 20mm",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/78/04/NW-K17803_K17804_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ic/al/Crane_D171A-D171AEXS_Technical.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ca/te/Crane_D171_1907008_WRAS_Certificate.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/tm/nt/Crane_StressCorrosionCracking_Sttmnt.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ta/ll/Crane_CopperAlloy_Ball_Valve_Install.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lever-operated, this valve is made of robust DZR brass with PTFE seals and a steel lever. The 100YL provides full flow with the minimum of turbulence when in the open position while the closed position ensures a bubble tight closure.  A ball valve is a type of quarter-turn valve featuring a hollow, perforated ball that pivots to control the flow of a fluid. The valve is open when the ball's hole is in line with flow and closed when pivoted to 90°. The long lasting reliability of ball valves makes them popular in a wide range of settings.","School's Out/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects.csv -> Hattersley Ball Valves 100YL DZR gas ball valve PN25 20mm",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/25/24/NW-K22524_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ta/ll/Hattersley_Fig100YL_BalValve_Install.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/te/ch/Hattersley_Fig100YL_BallValve_Tech.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A ball valve is a type of quarter-turn valve featuring a hollow, perforated ball that pivots to control the flow of a fluid. The valve is open when the ball's hole is in line with flow and closed when pivoted to 90°. The long lasting reliability of ball valves makes them popular in a wide range of settings.","School's Out/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects.csv -> Hattersley Ball Valves 100YL DZR gas ball valve PN25 50mm",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/25/28/NW-K22523_K22528_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ta/ll/Hattersley_Fig100YL_BalValve_Install.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/te/ch/Hattersley_Fig100YL_BallValve_Tech.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A smooth design helps to minimise flow restrictions while also ensuring it looks neat when installed on exposed pipelines. Precision-made, the ISR incorporates best-quality solder in each capillary socket, ready to create a reliable joint with no need to end feed. A solder joint is created through the principle of capillary action. When fitting and tube are heated to the correct temperature, the solder becomes molten, allowing it to be drawn into the gap between the two for a tough, reliable joint.","School's Out/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects.csv -> Center CB 635859 45deg  integral solder ring elbow 54mm",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/58/59/NW-635854_635859_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ic/al/635859_Center_Technical.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A ball valve is a type of quarter-turn valve featuring a hollow, perforated ball that pivots to control the flow of a fluid. The valve is open when the ball's hole is in line with flow and closed when pivoted to 90°. The long lasting reliability of ball valves makes them popular in a wide range of settings.","School's Out/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects/Pipe, Valves & Fittings | Maintenance Projects.csv -> Hattersley Fig 100 DZR ball valve (BSP) PN25 50mm",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/23/08/NW-K22303_K22308_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ca/te/Hattersley_Fig100_WRAS_Certificate.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ta/ll/Hattersley_Fig100_BallValve_Install.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/te/ch/Hattersley_Fig100_EXT_BallValve_Tech.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
