171,PG40386,Liff Limebeater electrolytic filter compression fitting 15mm (1),Liff,41.72,"The Liff Limebeater 2 Compact from LIFF uses electrolytic principles, designed for easy installation into existing, or new installations. Due to its compact size, and high quality finish, the Limebeater is ideal for use in restricted spaces, and where the finished installation is visible for the user to see. This electrolytic inhibitor requires no chemicals, or power supply, and is both environmentally friendly, and maintenance free. The scale reducer works by changing the structure of the hardness salts, inducing coagulation, and providing benefits to a range of appliances and as a result, provides protection for the whole house against scale, providing a more efficient central heating system. A more efficient system allows for a warmer, longer life boiler system, allowing for lower fuel bills and less maintenance costs.
