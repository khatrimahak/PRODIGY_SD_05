0,PN11359,"JET Range Automatic Air Vent Check Valve 3/8 x 1/2""",JET Range,8.0,"This JET Range automatic air vent with 3/8 x 1/2"" threaded connections is designed with a vacuum break to prevent air locks. A central heating safety device, the air vent releases built up air. As water flows through the system, a float opens or closes the vent depending on the water level. When the system is full the float is pushed to the top, closing the vent until the water level drops.","Heating/Sealed Heating Systems/Central Heating Air Vents/Central Heating Air Vents.csv -> JET Range Automatic Air Vent Check Valve 3/8 x 1/2""",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/13/59/N11359_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ui/de/N11359 Installation & User Guide.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/_t/ds/N11359 Auto Air Vent TDS.pdf,,,

Fitted at places where air tends to accumulate, causing corrosion and impacting thermal transfer, the Flexvent collects air, causing a float to drop and open its air release valve. In turn water pressure forces the air out of the system and the float rises again to close the valve. An air cushion is present in the upper part of the unit to protect the valve seat from contamination.","Heating/Sealed Heating Systems/Central Heating Air Vents/Central Heating Air Vents.csv -> Flamco Flexvent Automatic Air Vent 1/2""",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/10/85/NW-891085_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/og/ue/Flamco_Hydronic_Solutions_Catalogue.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/te/ch/Flamco_Flexvent_27740_Tech.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/tr/ct/Flamco_Flexvent_Install_Oper_Instrct.pdf,,
