0,P118755,Baxi Multifit vertical flue adaptor terminal,Baxi,44.28,"Under the Multifit brand, the telescopic flue kit for Baxi boilers provides a length of 350 - 500 mm, and flue lengths are available in 0.25 metre, 0.5 metre and 1 metre.  This means that there is hardly ever a need to cut a length of flue, reducing installation time and wastage, which is a particular consideration for new build.  The flue sections are joined using a simple push seal mechanism with two positive screw connections giving reassurance that the joint will not come apart. By popular demand, white, black and brown terminal options are now available to better blend into the building.  Where pluming is likely to be a nuisance, a new plume management kit has been introduced.  Available in black or white, the new kit can be retrofitted to the flue terminal and is competitively priced and easy to fit.  And for even greater flexibility, a new ridge tile terminal is available.",Heating/Flue & Chimney Systems/Flue Pipes/Flue Pipes.csv -> Baxi Multifit vertical flue adaptor terminal,,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/87/55/118755_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ui/de/Potterton_Gold_Tita_Guide.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ta/ll/Potterton_Gold_Tita_Guide_Install.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/hu/re/Baxi_Brochure.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
