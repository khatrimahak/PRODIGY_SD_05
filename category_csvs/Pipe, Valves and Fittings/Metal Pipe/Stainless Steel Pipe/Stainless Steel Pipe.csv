A slim, non-slip handle ensures reliable, ergonomic handling. This pressing tool is electrohydraulic, the battery-operated pressing tool is fitted with modern lithium-ion batteries. Thanks to the long battery running time it requires charging less often and, due to short charging times, it can be put back into operation quickly. Two rechargeable batteries are included in the tool‘s case enabling you to work with one rechargeable battery while the second is being charged. This tool comes with a bluetooth interface for the NovoCheck app. At larger dimensions (Mapress 42mm plus in diameter), collars are used for pressing rather than jaws.
