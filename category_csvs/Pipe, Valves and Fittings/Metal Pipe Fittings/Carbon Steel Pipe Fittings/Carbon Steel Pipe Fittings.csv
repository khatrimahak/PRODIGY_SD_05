The long lasting reliability of ball valves makes them popular in a wide range of settings.","Pipe, Valves and Fittings/Metal Pipe Fittings/Carbon Steel Pipe Fittings/Carbon Steel Pipe Fittings.csv -> Pegler VSH PowerPress DZR ball valve 1/2""",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/06/36/NW-500631_500636_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/st/al/Pegler_VSHPowerPress_48202979_Instal.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/hu/re/Pegler_VSH_PowerPress_Brochure.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
