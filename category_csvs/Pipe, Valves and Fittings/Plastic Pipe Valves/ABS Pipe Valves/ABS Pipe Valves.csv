Pressure ratings for thermoplastic pipe and fittings carrying water are quoted at 20°C and where the temperature increases, the working pressure must be reduced. ABS is resistant to most diluted inorganic acids, bases and salts and most animal oils and fats. A ball valve is a type of quarter-turn valve featuring a hollow, perforated ball that pivots to control the flow of a fluid. The valve is open when the ball's hole is in line with flow and closed when pivoted to 90°.
