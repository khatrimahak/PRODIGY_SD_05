A multiturn valve, operation of a gate valve is carried out via a threaded stem, turning multiple times to change position.","Pipe, Valves and Fittings/Metal Pipe Valves/Gate Valves/Gate Valves.csv -> JET Range 51 wheel head gate valve (BSP) PN20 15mm Bronze",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/44/51/NW-K74442_K74451_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/20/16/Jet_Valve_Guide_2016.pdf,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/ti/on/Jet_JET51_JET51LS_Installation.pdf,,
