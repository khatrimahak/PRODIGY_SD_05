A ball valve is a type of quarter-turn valve featuring a hollow, perforated ball that pivots to control the flow of a fluid. The valve is open when the ball's hole is in line with flow and closed when pivoted to 90°. The long lasting reliability of ball valves makes them popular in a wide range of settings.","Pipe, Valves and Fittings/Metal Pipe Valves/Ball Valves/Ball Valves.csv -> Ta-Chen SV20N 2-piece ball valve (BSPP) 50mm Stainless Steel",,,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/wol-web-proof-medium-w/std.lang.all/96/20/NW-K69611_K69620_wm.jpg,https://www.wolseley.co.uk/wcsstore/ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore/images/products/AssetPush/DTP_AssetPushHighRes/std.lang.all/20/16/Jet_Valve_Guide_2016.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
